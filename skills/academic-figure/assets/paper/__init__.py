"""Paper figures in the academic-figure design. `import paper` finds the DESIGN.md above this folder and
applies it to matplotlib; scripts then read `paper.colors` and call the helpers below.

design.py reads DESIGN.md; layout.py sizes the figure; palette.py keeps colors apart for color-blind
readers and in black and white; checks.py reports what reads badly; helpers.py holds helpers for drawing."""
